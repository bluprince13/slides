## Why invest (in the stock market)?

--

## Common ways to grow wealth

- Income
- Invest your existing wealth

Note:

- The first option costs time that you might otherwise spend with your family
  and friends or do something you enjoy.
- The second option requires you to accept a risk, but you could make money
  in your sleep.

--

## Retirement

- You cannot earn an income forever.
- There's a risk that you might live a long time after you retire.

Note:

- This also implies that it's lot better to invest when you're young than when
  you're old.

The fluctuations don't matter as much if you are investing for a long time.

## Summary

- Cash is NOT an investment. Cash is for spending.
- The stock market offers better returns than cash at higher risk.
- The risk is mitigated by diversification and time in the market.

# Assets: Stocks vs. funds

--

## Stocks

--

> Shares of stock let investors participate in the company’s success via
> increases in the stock’s price and through dividends.

<!-- .element: class="caption" -->

--

## Individual stocks are risky

--

## Solution: Diversify using funds

--

## Funds also offer convenience

- No need to manually buy individual stocks or rebalance their ratios over time
- More efficient for funds to buy stocks in a different currency
- `Accumulation` funds auto re-invest dividends

--

## Passive vs. Active funds

- Passive
  - Aims to replicate a given index
  - e.g. [Fidelity Index World
    Fund](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00BJS8SJ34-fidelity-index-world-fund-p-acc/key-statistics)
    follows the [MSCI World Index](https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/developed-markets).

- Active
  - Aims to outperform the returns of a specific benchmark
  - Typically more expensive
  - e.g. [Fundsmith Equity](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00B41YBW71-fundsmith-equity-fund-i-class-acc/key-statistics)
